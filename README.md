## How it Works

- The app loads the latest taxi data from [Singapore government API](https://data.gov.sg).
- All taxi positions are fetched once and stored.
- When you change the radius, only taxis inside that range are shown.
- The map intelligently zooms and recently centers on your location for better usability.
